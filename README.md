# Python Support Vector Machine for Facial Recognition
The Python script in this repo utilizes 5-Fold Cross Verification to execute a multi-classification SVM algorithm using both linear and polynomial kernels. A database consisting of 400 facial images, 10 samples for 40 subjects, was used to construct the training and testing datasets for each cross-verification.

The facial image database can be accessed at the following address:
